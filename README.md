# TwinCAT Framework

Dear friends,  
I'm happy to present an **open-source object-oriented framework for TwinCAT**, featuring several unique capabilities.  
If you're interested — below you'll find a Q&A-style overview.

---

## ❓ What is it?

This is an **object-oriented framework** for developing PLC applications with **Beckhoff TwinCAT**.  
It's written in **Structured Text**, using modern OOP principles and the latest language features (TwinCAT 3.1.4026).

---

## 🔧 What's it good for right now?

It enables:

- Building applications using modern OOP concepts
- Making your code more modular, readable, and flexible
- Enhancing standard Beckhoff libraries with additional functionality

---

## 💡 What does the framework offer today?

- ✅ Core logic is based on an **exception-handling mechanism**
- ✅ Support for **dynamic collections**: lists, dictionaries, unique lists
- ✅ Utilities for working with **long strings**
- ✅ JSON support classes
- ✅ An automation scaffold: `AutomationEngine` managing a collection of `AutomationUnits`
- 🔧 Many other components — either already ported or pending adaptation

---

## 📈 What are the future plans?

- 🧱 Wrap more standard libraries in OOP-style interfaces
- ⚠️ Full support for exception generation and propagation
- 🧪 Broaden **unit test** coverage (TcUnit-based)
- 📚 Improve documentation and examples

---

## ✅ How reliable is it?

- Partially covered by **unit tests** using [TcUnit](https://github.com/tcunit/TcUnit)
- That said, the framework should be considered **experimental** at this stage
- Note: TwinCAT itself still has **minor quirks** related to exception handling
- These issues aren't critical, and Beckhoff is aware and investigating solutions

---

## 🧱 Why do all classes inherit from `Object`?

Structured Text doesn't provide a universal base class for function blocks.  
To manage **dynamic memory deallocation**, we must know the actual type of the pointer.

- If the pointer refers to an FB, deallocation must occur via that FB pointer
- Otherwise, TwinCAT won't call the `FB_Exit` method

That's why we enforce inheritance from our own base class — `Object`.

---

## 🗂 Why this library structure?

There’s a joke among developers:  
> “Rule #1 of framework development — don’t create a framework.”

Designing one involves hard tradeoffs: architectural purity vs. usability.  
The current structure is the result of many iterations and refactorings.  
If you have suggestions — I’m all ears.

---

## ⏱ What’s the development pace?

Unfortunately: **irregular**.

> I live in a frontline city in Ukraine.  
> I work on this in my spare time — between day job tasks and the challenges of daily life here.

Development speed depends on:

1. Personal motivation  
2. Free time availability  
3. TwinCAT-related projects at my job  
4. Interest and feedback from other people

---

## 🤝 I want to help — how?

> “Two heads are better than one.”

There’s plenty to do:

- Core framework development  
- Writing tests  
- Improving documentation  
- Project visibility and outreach

If you're a fan of OOP, TwinCAT, or just want to help — get in touch!  
Also, if you're experienced in software architecture and have suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

## 🔍 How to get started?

1. Install the latest **TwinCAT XAE**  
2. Create a local folder (e.g. `D:\TwinCAT Framework`)  
3. Visit [my GitHub page](https://github.com/trofimich?tab=repositories)  
4. Clone [TwinCAT.OpenFramework repository](https://github.com/trofimich/TwinCAT.OpenFramework.git)
5. Open the solution in `TwinCAT.OpenFramework`

---

## 🧪 Are there examples?

Yes!  
Check the project **`TwinCAT.OpenFramework.Tests`** — it contains unit tests and examples for specific classes.
