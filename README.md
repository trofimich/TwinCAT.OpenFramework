# TwinCAT Framework

This is **object-oriented framework** developed for **TwinCAT 3.1.4026+**, which provides a set of ready-to-use, scalable components for industrial automation.
It is based on an error-handling concept that is unique for Structured Text and resembles the approach used in general-purpose languages like C# or Java.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic collections**  
  Work with an unknown number of elements at runtime.

- **String handling**  
  Convenient string concatenation from multiple parts, support for strings longer than 255 characters, and more.

- **Logging system**  
  A convenient logging system with advanced filtering capabilities based on topics and support for custom logger implementations.

- **Workflow engine**  
  A powerful engine for executing complex scenarios that can be composed dynamically. Basic activities such as Sequence, IfThenElse, While, WaitForVariableValue, WaitAndPick, etc., are already supported. Custom activities can also be created to meet individual requirements.
  
- **JSON support**  
  Simplified serialization and deserialization of structures to and from JSON documents.

- **Basic automation engine**  
  A ready-to-use state machine: AutomationRunner supports three fundamental states: *Initializing*, *Running*, *Fault* and can handle multiple AutomationController instances with four fundamental states: *Initializing*, *Running*, *Stopping*, *Fault*

- **Simulation mode for automation engine and devices**  
  Run your logic in simulation mode without the need for real hardware.

- **Controllable devices**  
  Ready-made abstractions for interacting with the external world, such as terminals or communication channels.

- **Device hierarchy**  
  Intuitive modeling of complex devices composed of simpler sub-devices, which in turn may be composed of even simpler ones.

- **Predefined device implementations**  
  Includes digital and analog I/O; more standard device types such as axes are planned.

- **Advanced exception handling**  
  An enhanced error management system that makes diagnostics easier by providing not only the message, but also the place and time the problem occurred.

- **Automatic exception logging**  
  The automation engine automatically catches exceptions and logs them.

- **Modular architecture**  
  Use only the parts of the framework you need ‚Äî no need to include everything.

- **Modern technologies and features**  
  Practical examples of object-oriented programming and the latest compiler features.

## üß™ Are there examples?

Yes, there are two projects:  
- **`TwinCAT.OpenFramework.Tests`** ‚Äî it contains unit tests and examples for specific classes.
- **`TwinCAT.OpenFramework.Samples`** ‚Äî it contains demo application with simple visualization. ![Read guid here.](Guides/SignalControlledIntersectionDemo.md)

## üîç How to get started?

1. Install the latest **TwinCAT XAE**  
2. Clone [TwinCAT.OpenFramework repository](https://github.com/trofimich/TwinCAT.OpenFramework.git)
3. Open the solution in `TwinCAT.OpenFramework`

---

## üìà What are the future plans?

- üß± Add new possibilities and wrap more standard libraries in OOP-style interfaces
- üß™ Broaden **unit test** coverage (TcUnit-based)
- üìö Improve documentation and examples

---

## üß± Why do all classes inherit from `Object`?

Structured Text doesn't provide a universal base class for function blocks.  
To manage **dynamic memory deallocation**, we must know the actual type of the pointer.

- If the pointer refers to an FB, deallocation must occur via that FB pointer
- Otherwise, TwinCAT won't call the `FB_Exit` method

That's why we enforce inheritance from our own base class ‚Äî `Object`.

## üóÇ Why this library structure?

Designing one involves hard tradeoffs: architectural purity vs. usability.  
The current structure is the result of many iterations and refactorings.  
If you have suggestions ‚Äî I‚Äôm all ears.

---

## ‚è± What‚Äôs the development pace?

Development speed depends on:

1. Personal motivation  
2. Free time availability  
3. TwinCAT-related projects at my job  
4. Interest and feedback from other people

---

## ü§ù I want to help ‚Äî how?

Currently you can:

- Share your remarks and ideas
- Help to write tests
- Help to create documentation  
- Project visibility and outreach

If you're a fan of OOP, TwinCAT, or just want to help ‚Äî get in touch!  
Also, if you're experienced in software architecture and have suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- Beckhoff currently use compiler from CoDeSys and this compiler has some issues:
  - incorrect behavior related to methods with optional parameters in some cases
  - incorrect memory deallocation in __TRY / __CATCH block in some cases

These issues aren't critical, and Beckhoff is aware and investigating solutions
